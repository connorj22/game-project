# Game-Project

For this project we had to make a game using everything we have learned so far. I decided to make an asteroid shooting game. The goal of the game is destroy the ateroids moving around the screen by targeting them with your mouse. Once you start the game it will present you with 4 different difficulties. If you manage to shoot all the asteroids without running out of ammo the game will present you with your stats from the past round.

## Getting Started

The game is deployed on GitHub Pages so all you will need to do is click the link and the game should load in your browser.

## Deployment

The game should already be deployed and playable

## Additional Documentation and Acknowledgments
